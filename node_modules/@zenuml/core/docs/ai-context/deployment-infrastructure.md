# Deployment & Infrastructure Documentation

This document contains deployment and infrastructure-related documentation for the project.

## Purpose

This template serves as a placeholder for documenting:
- Deployment strategies and procedures
- Infrastructure architecture and configuration
- CI/CD pipelines and automation
- Environment management
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Scaling strategies and considerations

## Implementation Note

Replace this template with your actual deployment and infrastructure documentation as your project develops. Focus on patterns and decisions that AI agents need to understand when working with infrastructure-related code or making architectural recommendations.

*Customize this template based on your specific deployment and infrastructure requirements.*

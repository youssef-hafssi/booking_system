# System Integration Documentation

This document contains cross-component integration patterns and system-wide architectural decisions.

## Purpose

This template serves as a placeholder for documenting:
- Cross-component communication patterns
- Data flow architectures between services
- Integration strategies with external systems
- Performance optimization patterns
- Testing strategies for integrated systems
- Error handling across service boundaries

## Implementation Note

Replace this template with your actual system integration documentation as your project develops. Focus on patterns that AI agents need to understand when working across component boundaries or implementing features that span multiple services.

---

*Customize this template based on your specific integration patterns and architectural requirements.*

# Task Management & Handoff Template

This file manages task continuity, session transitions, and knowledge transfer for AI-assisted development sessions.

## Purpose

This template helps maintain:
- **Session continuity** between AI development sessions
- **Task status tracking** for complex, multi-session work
- **Context preservation** when switching between team members
- **Knowledge transfer** for project handoffs
- **Progress documentation** for ongoing development efforts

## Current Session Status

### Active Tasks
Document currently in-progress work:

```markdown
## In Progress
- [ ] Task 1: [Brief description]
  - Status: [Started/Blocked/Awaiting review]
  - Context: [Relevant files, decisions made]
  - Next steps: [What needs to be done next]
  - Dependencies: [What this task depends on]

- [ ] Task 2: [Brief description]
  - Status: [Current status]
  - Files modified: [List of files changed]
  - Challenges: [Any issues encountered]
  - Notes: [Important context for continuation]
```

### Pending Tasks
Document queued work:

```markdown
## Pending
- [ ] Task A: [Description]
  - Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
  - Dependencies: [What must be completed first]
  - Estimated effort: [Time estimate]
  - Context: [Background information]

- [ ] Task B: [Description]
  - Priority: [Priority level]
  - Requirements: [Specific requirements or constraints]
  - Resources needed: [Tools, access, information needed]
```

### Completed Tasks
Track completed work for context:

```markdown
## Completed This Session
- [x] Task X: [Description]
  - Completed: [Date]
  - Outcome: [What was accomplished]
  - Files changed: [Modified files]
  - Notes: [Important decisions or lessons learned]

- [x] Task Y: [Description]
  - Completed: [Date]
  - Impact: [How this affects other tasks]
  - Follow-up needed: [Any follow-up actions required]
```

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Recent Decisions
Document architectural decisions made during development:

```markdown
## Design Decisions Made
- **Decision**: [What was decided]
  - Date: [When decision was made]
  - Rationale: [Why this approach was chosen]
  - Alternatives considered: [Other options evaluated]
  - Impact: [How this affects the system]
  - Validation: [How to verify this was the right choice]

- **Decision**: [Another decision]
  - Context: [Situation that led to this decision]
  - Trade-offs: [What was gained/lost with this choice]
  - Dependencies: [What this decision depends on]
```

### Technical Debt & Issues
Track technical debt and known issues:

```markdown
## Technical Debt Identified
- **Issue**: [Description of technical debt]
  - Location: [Where in codebase]
  - Impact: [How it affects development/performance]
  - Proposed solution: [How to address it]
  - Priority: [When should this be addressed]

- **Issue**: [Another issue]
  - Root cause: [Why this debt exists]
  - Workaround: [Current mitigation strategy]
  - Long-term fix: [Proper solution approach]
```

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate Priorities
Define what should be tackled next:

```markdown
## Next Session Priorities
1. **Primary Goal**: [Main objective for next session]
   - Success criteria: [How to know this is complete]
   - Prerequisites: [What must be ready beforehand]
   - Estimated effort: [Time estimate]

2. **Secondary Goal**: [Secondary objective]
   - Dependencies: [What this depends on]
   - Resources needed: [Tools, information, access required]

3. **If Time Permits**: [Optional tasks]
   - Context: [Background on why these are valuable]
   - Preparation: [What needs to be done to start these]
```

### Knowledge Gaps
Document areas needing research or clarification:

```markdown
## Knowledge Gaps to Address
- **Question**: [What needs to be clarified]
  - Impact: [How this affects current work]
  - Research needed: [What investigation is required]
  - Decision maker: [Who can answer this]

- **Unknown**: [Technical uncertainty]
  - Options: [Possible approaches to explore]
  - Experiments: [What should be tested]
  - Timeline: [When this needs to be resolved]
```

## Context for Continuation

### Key Files & Components
Document important files for session continuity:

```markdown
## Files Currently Being Modified
- `[file-path]`: [Purpose and current changes]
- `[file-path]`: [What's being implemented here]
- `[file-path]`: [Status and next steps]

## Important Context Files
- `[context-file]`: [Why this is relevant]
- `[documentation]`: [What information this contains]
- `[reference]`: [How this relates to current work]
```

### Development Environment
Document environment and setup considerations:

```markdown
## Environment Status
- **Development setup**: [Current state of dev environment]
- **Database**: [Schema changes, migrations, data state]
- **External services**: [API keys, service configurations]
- **Testing**: [Test suite status, coverage, failing tests]
- **Build/Deploy**: [Build status, deployment considerations]
```

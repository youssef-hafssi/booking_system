   - Established one-to-many relationship with Reservation entity

5. **Reservation Entity**
   - Created Reservation class with attributes: id, startTime, endTime, status, notes, createdAt, updatedAt
   - Implemented ReservationStatus enum (PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED)
   - Established many-to-one relationships with User and WorkStation entities
   - Established one-to-many relationship with Notification entity

6. **Notification Entity**
   - Created Notification class with attributes: id, message, sentAt, readAt, status, type, channel
   - Implemented NotificationType enum (CONFIRMATION, REMINDER, CANCELLATION, MODIFICATION)
   - Implemented NotificationChannel enum (EMAIL, SMS, IN_APP)
   - Implemented NotificationStatus enum (PENDING, SENT, FAILED)
   - Established many-to-one relationships with User and Reservation entities

### Testing Infrastructure

1. **Test Controller**
   - Created TestController with endpoints to verify application functionality
   - Implemented /api/test/ping endpoint to check if application is running
   - Implemented /api/test/db-connection endpoint to verify database connectivity

2. **Testing Documentation**
   - Created TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md with detailed steps for testing the application
   - Added Postman collection for API testing

## VERIFICATION AND TESTING (COMPLETED)

1. **Application Startup**
   - Successfully started Spring Boot application on port 8080
   - Verified application is running correctly

2. **Database Connection**
   - Successfully connected to MariaDB (version 10.4.32) running on XAMPP
   - Verified database connection through test endpoint
   - Confirmed database schema creation based on entity models

3. **API Testing**
   - Successfully tested /api/test/ping endpoint
   - Successfully tested /api/test/db-connection endpoint
   - Verified correct JSON responses from both endpoints

## NEXT STEPS (PHASE 2)

1. **Backend Development**
   - Create repositories for database access
   - Implement service layer business logic
   - Develop REST controllers for API endpoints

2. **Frontend Configuration**
   - Set up React Router for navigation
   - Configure state management
   - Implement API service with Axios
   - Create base layout components

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2.0
- **Database**: MariaDB 10.4.32 (via XAMPP)
- **ORM**: Hibernate with JPA
- **Security**: Spring Security
- **Frontend**: React (to be implemented)
- **API Documentation**: Postman collection

## CONCLUSION

Phase 1 of the Workstation Reservation System project has been successfully completed. The application has a solid foundation with all entities properly modeled according to the database schema. The backend is configured to work with XAMPP MySQL server running on port 3306, and basic testing infrastructure is in place to verify functionality.

The project is now ready to move to Phase 2, which will focus on implementing the business logic and API endpoints for the backend, as well as setting up the frontend infrastructure.

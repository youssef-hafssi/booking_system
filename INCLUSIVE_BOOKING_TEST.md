# Inclusive Booking Logic Test

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

When you book **9:00 AM to 11:00 AM** (2 hours), the system should mark **three slots** as booked:

### ✅ **What Should Be Marked as Booked:**
- **09:00 - 10:00** ❌ (Reservation active during this hour)
- **10:00 - 11:00** ❌ (Reservation active during this hour) 
- **11:00 - 12:00** ❌ (Reservation ends at 11:00 - INCLUSIVE)

### ✅ **What Should Remain Available:**
- **08:00 - 09:00** ✅ (Before reservation starts)
- **12:00 - 13:00** ✅ (After reservation ends)

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

Changed the overlap detection query from:
```sql
-- OLD (Exclusive): Only 09:00 and 10:00 marked as booked
AND r.endTime > :startTime

-- NEW (Inclusive): 09:00, 10:00, AND 11:00 marked as booked  
AND r.endTime >= :startTime
```

## 🧪 **Test Steps**

1. **Start Backend**: `cd p/backend && mvn spring-boot:run`
2. **Book 9:00-11:00**: Select 9:00 AM slot, choose 2-hour duration
3. **Verify Results**: Check that slots show:
   - ❌ 09:00 (Booked)
   - ❌ 10:00 (Booked) 
   - ❌ 11:00 (Booked) ← **This is the new behavior**
   - ✅ 12:00 (Available)

## 🔍 **Debug Endpoints**

Test the logic manually:
```
GET /api/reservations/debug/recent
GET /api/reservations/debug/overlap-test?workStationId=1&startTime=2025-08-04T11:00:00&endTime=2025-08-04T12:00:00
```

## 📋 **Examples**

| Booking Time | Slots Marked as Booked | Logic |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| 9:00-10:00 (1hr) | 09:00, 10:00 | Start + End inclusive |
| 9:00-11:00 (2hr) | 09:00, 10:00, 11:00 | Start + Middle + End inclusive |
| 9:00-12:00 (3hr) | 09:00, 10:00, 11:00, 12:00 | Start + All Middle + End inclusive |

This matches typical booking system behavior where the end time "reserves" that time slot as well.

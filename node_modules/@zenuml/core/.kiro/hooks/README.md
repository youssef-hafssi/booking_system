# Kiro Agent Hooks

This directory contains custom hooks that automatically execute when specific events occur in Kiro.

## Session Sound Notification Hook

**File:** `session-sound-notification.json` and `session-sound-notification.js`

**Purpose:** Plays system sounds to notify you when:

- An AI session completes
- User input is required to continue
- An error occurs

**Sounds Used (macOS):**

- **Session Complete:** Glass.aiff - A pleasant chime when tasks finish
- **Input Required:** Sosumi.aiff - An attention-getting sound when you need to respond
- **Error:** Basso.aiff - A distinctive sound for errors
- **Default:** Ping.aiff - Fallback sound

**Configuration:**
The hook is enabled by default and will auto-execute. You can disable it by setting `"enabled": false` in the JSON configuration file.

**Platform Notes:**

- Currently optimized for macOS using the `afplay` command
- Uses built-in system sounds located in `/System/Library/Sounds/`
- For other platforms, the sound files and playback command would need to be adjusted

## Managing Hooks

You can:

1. View current hooks in the Kiro Explorer under "Agent Hooks"
2. Use Command Palette â†’ "Open Kiro Hook UI" to create new hooks
3. Edit hook files directly in this directory
4. Enable/disable hooks by modifying the `enabled` property
